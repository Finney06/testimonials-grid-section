## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use css grid system to align the blocks in it right place and also learnt the filter feature in css to give the design some coolhover effect.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.block {
  filter: grayscale(.5) blur(.6px);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn ore on grid and how o use it to align items properly in coding out a design and start getting use in using javascript in the nearest future.
